Before enhancement:
-------------------

 1  node: 00:00:08.677
 4 nodes: 00:00:09.902
10 nodes: 00:00:21.156
20 nodes: 00:00:40.251
50 nodes: 00:01:38.513

After enhancement (% less time):
--------------------------------

 1  node: 00:00:07.942 ==>  8.470 %
 4 nodes: 00:00:09.207 ==>  7.018 %
10 nodes: 00:00:17.615 ==> 16.738 %
20 nodes: 00:00:31.147 ==> 22.618 %
50 nodes: 00:01:11.932 ==> 26.982 %
